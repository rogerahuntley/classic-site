	   	<div>
		  <p>So this project was going to be some sort of Minecraft/Terraria knock-off in JavaScript.<br><br>I had seen someone else make something like this before, and they ended up abandoning it, very much to my dismay. I really wanted to see it finished, so I started working on an inspired prototype myself.<br><br>I started having a lot of fun playing around with making maps and building stuff, but the code was very limited, and the jumping/movement code was super janky.<br><br>This was the last of my senior-year prototypes, and probably the most interesting one of them all, at least gameplay-wise.<br><br>I just wasn't equipped to write smooth-feeling platformer code at the time.</p>
		  <p>I really did dig these sprites too, even though they were just placeholders at the time</p>
    <h3>Controls</h3>
    <p>Use WASD to move. Hold shift to run.</p>
    <p>Type the password "debugmode" to activate debug mode.</p>
=======
    <p>Use WASD to move. Press shift to change what block you're going to place, and press any of the keys around your character to place a block in that selected spot.</p>
